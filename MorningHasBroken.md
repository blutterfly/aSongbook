[C] [F] [C] [G] [C]

[C]Morning has [F]broken, like the first [C]morning
[C]Blackbird has [Em]spoken, like the first [Am]bird
[F]Praise for the [C]singing, [F]praise for the [C]morning
[F]Praise for them [C]springing [G]fresh from the [C]word

[C] [F] [C] [G] [C]

[C]Sweet the rain's [F]new fall, sunlit from [C]heaven
[C]Like the first [Em]dewfall, on the first [Am]grass
[F]Praise for the [C]sweetness, [F]of the wet [C]garden
[F]Sprung in com[C]pleteness [G]where His feet [C]pass

{comment: Bridge}
[C] [F] [C] [G] [C]

[C]Mine is the [F]sunlight, mine is the [C]morning
[C]Born of the [Em]one light, Eden saw [Am]play
[F]Praise with e[C]lation, [F]praise every [C]morning
[F]God's re-cre[C]ation [G]of the new [C]day
